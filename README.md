## Prerequisites:
- you must have the Lua interpreter installed on your system, I'm using 5.4.1, but any version of Lua 5.1 and above should be just fine.
- you must have SDL2 and SDL2_image installed on your system, you should use your Linux distro's package manager to do this.
- or if your on MacOS X, install brew and then install SDl2 and SDl2_image.
- A C99 complaint compiler.

## How do I build this?
To build a binary and run this, open your terminal and cd or navigate to wherever you have this on your system.

Next, enter 'make game' - this will produce the binary, given that there are no errors in your code.

Finally, to run the binary, enter './main'
